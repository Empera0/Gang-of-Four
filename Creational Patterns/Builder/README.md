This code implements the **Builder design pattern** to model pizza making. The Builder pattern provides an abstract class for constructing an object. Its concrete subclasses build the object by specifying its **different properties.**

The program contains a Pizza class that represents a pizza product. It has private member variables for the type of dough, sauce, and topping used in the pizza. Public setter methods are provided to set these properties, and a showPizza() method displays the details of the pizza.

A PizzaBuilder abstract class provides an interface for building a pizza. It has a protected member variable of type Pizza, and a virtual destructor. Concrete subclasses of PizzaBuilder specify the type of dough, sauce, and topping to be used in the pizza, and construct the pizza by setting these properties.

In the main function, a Director class is used to build a specific type of pizza by creating an instance of the corresponding concrete PizzaBuilder subclass, setting its properties, and returning the constructed Pizza object. The Pizza is then displayed using its showPizza() method.

**Some advantages of the Builder design pattern are:**

1- Abstracts object creation: The Builder pattern is used to abstract the process of object creation. This enables client code that doesn't know how an **object is constructed to create objects.**

2- Simplifies object configuration: The Builder pattern explicitly defines the structure and properties of an object. This makes **object configuration easier and more understandable.**

3- Increases flexibility: The Builder pattern makes it easy to modify the structure of an object. For example, when you want to **create objects with different properties, you can create a new Concrete Builder class.**

4- Hides details of created object: The Builder pattern hides the details of the created object. This allows client code to use **the created object without having to know the object's internal structure.**

5- Facilitates creation of multi-step object structures: The Builder pattern makes it easy to create object structures that involve multiple steps. Each step can be defined in a different Concrete Builder class. **This makes it easier to create complex object structures.**
