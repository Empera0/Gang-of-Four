# Abstract Factory

The Abstract Factory design pattern facilitates the creation
 of related objects and reduces the dependency between
 objects. It offers the following advantages:

1- Abstraction of object creation process: Abstract Factory
abstracts the process of creating objects, making it independent
of the actual implementation details of the application. **This
ensures minimal impact of changes on the rest of the application.**

2- Consistency of objects: **Abstract Factory enables the creation
of a group of objects that are consistent with each other.** This
minimizes code repetition and reduces errors in object creation.

3- Replaceability of objects: Abstract Factory provides a **flexible
structure to support different variations of objects**. Creating a
new factory class is sufficient to add a new type of object or
change an existing one.

4- Reusability of code: Abstract Factory enables code reuse by
creating **multiple factory classes for the same product** family but
with different variations. This makes maintenance and extension
of code easier.

5- Testability of code: Abstract Factory makes the production of
objects separate, making **test code less complex**. Factory classes
and product classes can be tested separately, ensuring better
test coverage.

In summary, the code defines a set of related objects (Buttons)
that are created through an Abstract Factory pattern. The concrete
products (WindowsButton and MacOSButton) are implementations of the
abstract product (Button), and the concrete factories (WindowsFactory
and MacOSFactory) are implementations of the abstract factory
(GUIFactory). The Application class is the client that uses the
factory to create the correct Button object, and then calls the
paint() method to display it on the screen.
