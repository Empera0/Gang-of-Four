# Singleton

For example, let's say you're working in an office where everyone needs to use the same printer.
But if everyone starts using different printers, things can get confusing. In this case, by using
the Singleton pattern, we can ensure that everyone in the office is using the same printer.
This makes the office work more efficiently and in an organized manner.

So, the Singleton pattern is a commonly used design pattern in the programming
world and can also be applied to any workplace. As mentioned earlier,
this pattern ensures that everyone is using the same object and makes things more organized.
