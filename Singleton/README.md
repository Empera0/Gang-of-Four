# Singleton

**1-**Singleton is a design pattern that **ensures a class has only one instance**,
thus allowing the application to use only one instance at any point.
This reduces resource usage and minimizes the cost of object creation.

**2-**Because the instance is created only once, the Singleton design pattern is
useful, **especially for resource-consuming objects like database connections.
Creating these objects every time can increase resource consumption and affect performance negatively.**

**3-**The Singleton design pattern should be designed as thread-safe to prevent
multiple objects from being created simultaneously. This prevents multiple
threads from trying to create instances at the same time.

**4-**The Singleton design pattern can be implemented in many modern programming
languages. For example, in Java, the Singleton design pattern is implemented
using the "static" keyword and a "private" constructor method. In other languages
like C#, the "static" keyword is used, and a "GetInstance" method is used to
return an instance.
