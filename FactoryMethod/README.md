For example, imagine that you run a pastry shop. Instead of making the pastries yourself, you have made an agreement with a pastry chain. The pastry chain continuously supplies you with pastries. But what is important to you is not how the pastries are made, but rather that the pastry chain delivers the pastries to you.

This is exactly what the Factory Method design pattern does. When a client code wants to create an object instance, it sends a request to create the object via an interface without knowing the creation process of the classes. Then, this process takes place through the subclasses and the client code does not know from which subclass the created object was derived.

1 - Provides a way to delegate the object creation logic to subclasses, thereby promoting code reuse and reducing tight coupling between objects.

2 - Allows for easy addition of new subclasses without modifying existing client code, as the client code only depends on the abstract interface and not the concrete implementations.

3 - Supports the Open/Closed Principle, as it allows for extension of the behavior of the factory method without modifying the existing code.

4 - Increases the flexibility and maintainability of code by encapsulating the object creation logic in a single location.
