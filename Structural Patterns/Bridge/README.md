The Bridge design pattern is used to separate two hierarchies of classes. One hierarchy is abstract and the other is concrete, forming two parts. The abstract part allows the application code to access it directly, while the concrete part is the lower part that fulfills the requests coming from the abstract part.

In our example, we will demonstrate the Bridge pattern using the process of car manufacturing. During car production, various manufacturing processes may need to be carried out in different workshops. By abstracting these workshops and their interfaces using the Bridge pattern, the application code is prevented from directly interacting with these workshops. This means that any updates or changes to the workshops will not require changes to the application code.

In our example, we define the **ICarWorkshop** interface for car manufacturing, which contains the necessary functions for car production. We create the abstract classes **ICarAssemblyWorkshop** and **ICarProductionWorkshop** for different workshops that will be used for car manufacturing. The **ICarWorkshop** interface will use these classes to carry out the manufacturing processes for cars.

We create the Sedan and SUV classes to represent different car types. These classes use the **ICarWorkshop** interface to carry out car manufacturing. Each car type will have different **ICarAssemblyWorkshop** and **ICarProductionWorkshop** objects for the manufacturing processes.

The **BodyShop** and **EngineShop** classes are derived from the **ICarAssemblyWorkshop** and **ICarProductionWorkshop** abstract classes. These classes represent different workshops and carry out the production of different parts used in the manufacturing processes.

1 - Separation of Concerns: The Bridge design pattern separates the abstract interface from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently. This separation of concerns makes the code more maintainable and flexible.

2 - Functionality Extension: When new functionality is added, the Bridge design pattern is used by adding a new hierarchy instead of changing the existing one. This new hierarchy can be used in place of the existing one and can be extended without making any changes to the old code.

3 - Decreased Functionality: The Bridge design pattern, due to the abstraction of interfaces, can make some functionality harder to use. Therefore, it is not recommended for use in small-scale projects.
