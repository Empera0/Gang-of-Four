*Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides*, also known as the **"Gang of Four,"** have made significant contributions to the field of software design patterns. In their book *"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software,"* published in 1994, these four individuals identified the **most important design patterns used in software design.**

The book includes **23 different design patterns** that solve recurring problems in software design, **categorized into three types: creational, structural, and behavioral.**

**Creational patterns** are concerned with object creation. These patterns address issues related to creating objects, the instantiation process, and types of instantiation.

**Structural patterns** are concerned with the composition of classes and objects. These patterns focus on topics such as assembling objects, combining classes, and defining interfaces.

**Behavioral patterns** are concerned with the behavior and communication of objects. These patterns address how objects interact with each other, how they work together, and how their behavior is managed.

This repository is designed as a resource that contains explanations of the "Gang of Four" design patterns. Each design pattern is **thoroughly explained and supported with examples**.
